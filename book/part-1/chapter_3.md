Within the maze-like streets of Transformerland, there's a plaza that's always bustling with activity. It's the heart of the city, where words truly understand their relationships with one another. This place is known as the Self-Attention Square. As our friend "apple" continues its adventure, it reaches this square, ready to explore the magic that unfolds here.

## **Chapter 3: The Magic of Self-Attention**

After its enlightening experiences in Transformerland, "apple" is eager to dive deeper. It has heard tales of a place where words see reflections not just of themselves but of every other word, understanding their significance in a broader context. It's here that "apple" will learn the magic of self-attention.

**Understanding the Self-Attention Mechanism**

As "apple" enters the Self-Attention Square, it's greeted by a myriad of mirrors. But these aren't ordinary mirrors. Each one captures the essence of every word in relation to "apple." One mirror might show "apple" alongside "crunchy," emphasizing its texture. Another might reflect "apple" beside "orchard," highlighting its origin.

To get technical for a moment, these mirrors compute a weighted representation of all words in a sentence concerning "apple." These weights determine how much attention "apple" should pay to other words when trying to define itself in a specific context.

Imagine a sentence: "I ate an apple at the tech event." Here, the words "ate" and "tech" pull "apple" in different directionsâ€”one towards food and the other towards a company. The self-attention mechanism helps "apple" balance these influences to understand its role in this sentence.

**Multi-Head Attention and its Benefits**

While exploring, "apple" notices that some mirrors are grouped together, labeled as "Multi-Head Attention." Intrigued, "apple" learns that while one set of mirrors (or one "head") might focus on syntactic aspects (like "apple" being an object of "ate"), another might focus on semantic aspects (like "apple" being related to "tech").

For instance, consider the sentence: "Apple launched a juicy new phone." One set of mirrors (head) might highlight the relationship between "Apple" and "phone," while another emphasizes the adjective "juicy," giving a dual perspective.

In code, this is achieved by having multiple sets of weight matrices and combining their outputs. It's like viewing a scene from different camera angles to get a comprehensive understanding.

```python
# Simplified Multi-Head Attention in Code

def multi_head_attention(input, num_heads):
    heads_output = []
    for i in range(num_heads):
        # Apply self-attention mechanism for each head
        head_output = self_attention(input)
        heads_output.append(head_output)
    
    # Combine outputs of all heads
    combined_output = concatenate(heads_output)
    return combined_output
```

In this code snippet, the function `multi_head_attention` takes an input (like our sentence) and applies the `self_attention` mechanism multiple times(this just an imaginary method for now), once for each head. The outputs of all these heads are then combined to provide a richer understanding.



### **Chapter 3.5: Unraveling the Self-Attention Secret**

Having seen many sights in Transformerland, "apple" was excited about the Self-Attention Square. Here, it heard, words learn about themselves and their friends. They understand how they fit into the big picture.

**1. A World of Special Mirrors**

As "apple" entered the square, it saw lots of mirrors. But these mirrors were different. Instead of showing just one reflection, they showed many. "Apple" wasn't alone; it was with "tree," "juice," "pie," and more.

The magic behind this? Every word changes into three forms: Query, Key, and Value. Think of them as different costumes each word wears.

```python
def change_into_forms(input_words, W_query, W_key, W_value):
    queries = np.dot(input_words, W_query)
    keys = np.dot(input_words, W_key)
    values = np.dot(input_words, W_value)
    return queries, keys, values
```

"Apple" thought, "How do these mirrors decide which words to show more clearly?"

**2. The Dance of Connections**

Each word, in its Query costume, dances with all other words in their Key costumes. The better they dance together, the clearer they appear in the mirror.

```python
def find_dance_partners(queries, keys):
    dance_scores = np.dot(queries, keys.T)
    return dance_scores
```

But not all dances are equal. Some are too fast or too slow. They need balance.

**3. The Balancing Fountain**

In the middle of the square, there's a magical fountain. Words take their dance scores, splash them in the fountain, and the scores become balanced.

```python
def balance_dances(dance_scores):
    balanced_scores = np.exp(dance_scores) / np.sum(np.exp(dance_scores), axis=1, keepdims=True)
    return balanced_scores
```

With these balanced scores, the mirrors show a beautiful story where each word knows its importance.

**4. Creating a New Story**

With balanced scores in hand, "apple" saw its story change in the mirror. It was a mix of its own tale and tales of words around it.

```python
def mix_stories(balanced_scores, values):
    mixed_story = np.dot(balanced_scores, values)
    return mixed_story
```

**5. The Magic of Many Views**

While looking around, "apple" found some special mirrors named "Multi-Head Mirrors." Each showed a different view. Some focused on relationships, while others highlighted qualities.

```python
def many_views(input_story, num_views):
    views_output = []
    for i in range(num_views):
        view_output = self_attention(input_story)  # This bundles the magic from steps 1-4
        views_output.append(view_output)
    
    full_story = np.concatenate(views_output, axis=-1)
    return full_story
```

With these different views, "apple" felt it truly understood its place in Transformerland's stories.

---

As evening fell, "apple" left the square, its heart full. The Self-Attention Square had shown it not just how special it was, but how every word was a star in Transformerland's sky.

In this chapter, we've taken a stroll through the magic of self-attention, blending a simple story with easy-to-follow code, making the wonders of the Transformer architecture accessible to all.
