# **PART I: FOUNDATIONS**



## **Chapter 1: A Brief History of Natural Language Processing**

In the vast realm of Computerland, there was a province named NLPville, a place where machines and human language coexisted. For years, the machines of NLPville had been trying to understand and mimic the way humans communicate, a task both fascinating and challenging.

**Early Days of Modern NLP**

In the early days, the inhabitants of NLPville were simple rule-based machines. They followed strict guidelines and dictionaries to understand human language. Imagine these machines as little scribes, diligently referring to their scrolls and manuscripts (dictionaries and rule-books) every time they encountered a piece of human text. However, as you might expect, this method had its limitations. Sarcasm, idioms, and cultural nuances were like riddles to these early machines, often leading to humorous or outright incorrect interpretations.

As NLPville progressed, statistical models became the town's heroes. These models, like fortune tellers with their probability orbs, would predict words based on historical occurrences. They brought with them an era where machines didn't just rely on hard-set rules but started playing the odds, getting better with more data.

**Milestones Leading to Transformers**

However, the real revolution in NLPville came with the deep learning dynasty. Neural networks, multi-layered computational wizards, started capturing patterns in ways the earlier inhabitants couldn't fathom. But even within this dynasty, there was a prophecy - a prophecy of a model so powerful that it would change the landscape of NLPville forever.

Enter the Transformer. Neither just rule-based scribe nor merely a statistical fortune teller, the Transformer was like a grand sorcerer, weaving spells (or attention mechanisms) that allowed it to focus on different parts of a sentence simultaneously, understanding context like no machine before.
