Having explored the Self-Attention Square, "apple" is intrigued by another aspect of Transformerland: the art of positioning. In the world of language, where you stand often defines who you are. And so, "apple" ventures forth to understand the significance of its position in the grand narrative of sentences.

## **Chapter 4: Positional Encodings & Embeddings**

As "apple" strolls through Transformerland, it reaches a magnificent observatory, the Positional Encoding Tower. Here, words don't just learn about themselves, but also where they stand in the vast landscape of a sentence. It's not just about being an "apple"; it's about being the "apple" that was eaten, thrown, or admired.

**Why Position Matters**

Within the tower, "apple" quickly realizes the importance of its position. It recalls sentences like "Apple released a new product" and "A new apple product is delicious." In one, "apple" is a tech giant; in the other, a tasty fruit. Its meaning often shifts based on where it stands.

To break it down, consider the phrase, "She told him." Swap the positions, and you get "He told her." The words remain the same, but the entire narrative changes. Position is pivotal.

**Different Methods of Positional Encoding**

Curious about how this positioning magic works, "apple" explores various rooms in the tower, each dedicated to a unique method of positional encoding.

1. **Sinusoidal Encoding Room:** In this room, "apple" finds a series of oscillating waves on screens. These waves, sines, and cosines, represent positions. The beauty of these waves is their ability to capture positions in long sentences without the need for vast amounts of data. It's like having a unique rhythmic beat for each position in a sentence.

    ```python
    def sinusoidal_positional_encoding(position, dimension):
        angle_rates = 1 / np.power(10000, (2 * (dimension // 2)) / np.float32(dimension))
        angle_radians = position * angle_rates
        # Apply sine to even indices, cosine to odd indices
        encodings = np.zeros(angle_radians.shape)
        encodings[:, 0::2] = np.sin(angle_radians[:, 0::2])
        encodings[:, 1::2] = np.cos(angle_radians[:, 1::2])
        return encodings
    ```

    This code snippet showcases how sinusoidal waves are used to generate positional encodings. Different positions in a sentence get distinct wave patterns, ensuring each word's position is uniquely represented.

2. **Learned Positional Encoding Room:** Here, "apple" finds another method. Instead of fixed patterns like sines and cosines, positions are learned over time, adapting to the data. It's akin to learning landmarks in a new city.

    ```python
    class LearnedPositionalEncoding(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, embedding_dim, max_position=512):
            super().__init__()
            self.positional_embeddings = nn.Embedding(max_position, embedding_dim)

        def forward(self, sequence_length):
            positions = torch.arange(sequence_length).unsqueeze(0)
            return self.positional_embeddings(positions)
    ```

    In this code, the model learns the best representation for each position as it trains on more data. The `nn.Embedding` layer captures the essence of each position, refining it over time.

As "apple" departs from the Positional Encoding Tower, it's not just knowledgeable about its essence and relationships but also its unique place in the grand tapestry of sentences. It realizes that in Transformerland, every word is a story, every relationship a narrative, and every position a unique perspective.

By intertwining technical details with a continuous narrative, this chapter aims to demystify the concept of positional encodings, making it both captivating and clear.
